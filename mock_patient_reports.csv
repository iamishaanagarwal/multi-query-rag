1,Alice Mathews,"The patient presented with a persistent dry cough lasting over three weeks, accompanied by intermittent fever and night sweats. Chest X-ray showed mild bilateral infiltrates, and blood tests revealed elevated ESR and CRP levels. A sputum culture was negative for bacterial infection, but due to the persistence of symptoms, a CT scan was performed revealing ground-glass opacities suggestive of atypical pneumonia. The patient was started on a course of azithromycin and corticosteroids. Pulmonology consultation advised close monitoring and a follow-up HRCT in 4 weeks. Patient was advised rest, hydration, and regular monitoring of oxygen saturation at home."
2,Brian Singh,"Patient reported episodes of severe abdominal pain localized to the right upper quadrant, especially after meals. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of multiple gallstones with evidence of gallbladder wall thickening. Liver function tests were mildly deranged, and a HIDA scan confirmed delayed emptying of the gallbladder. After surgical evaluation, the patient was scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preoperative workup including CBC, coagulation profile, and ECG were within normal limits. Postoperative plan includes antibiotics, pain management, and a gradual return to normal diet. Patient educated on signs of infection and advised to avoid fatty foods."
3,Chloe Fernandez,"The patient, a 45-year-old female with a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, presented with sudden onset chest discomfort, radiating to the left arm. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicative of an inferior wall myocardial infarction. Troponin levels were elevated. Emergency coronary angiography revealed 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and a drug-eluting stent was successfully placed. The patient was stabilized in the ICU and started on dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. Cardiology team emphasized the importance of lifestyle modifications, cardiac rehab, and medication adherence. Patient discharged with instructions for follow-up in 1 week and enrollment in a cardiac rehabilitation program."
